MelTheBot was a discord bot that I used to run using this code from mid 2020 to early 2021. It was a fun project for me to do during lockdown when I was around 13. I'm uploading the original source code here as something to look back on and because I am reviving the project with my friend who I originally started this with but under a new name, Omni.

You are free to use this code however you want but be warned: this code is **very outdated and probably will not work.** Have fun with it :D
